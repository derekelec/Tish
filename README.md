# Tish
Texted commanded messenger real time strategy game

Tish is essentially a fun challenging strategy game, in whch two vs two will race each
other to reach the furthest level. Each 2-player team will work together through the puzzles communicating only through the
games text (potentially put game as text based application). The text will be limited by spelling, word usage, and several 
other chellenges (open to suggestions). The teams will have to navigate there way through the game with the limited communcation
adding a second layer to the puzzle.

Tish will bring together two people and provide an equally challenging, funny, and imagitave spin on communication.
